<!-- Add new tasks with details such as the task name, category, deadline, and status.
Update the status of tasks to reflect their progress (e.g., “In Progress,” “Completed,” “Overdue”).
Automatically update task status based on the current date (tasks past their deadline will be marked as “Overdue”).
Filter tasks by status or category.
Persist task data using local storage so tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.
